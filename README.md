# Power Platform AI Toolkit

A self-contained setup and skills repository for AI-assisted Power Apps development.

Point your AI coding agent at this repo and tell it to set up your Power Apps environment — it reads the instructions here, installs everything it needs, configures MCP servers, asks what you want to build, and then builds it.

---

## For AI agents — start here

> **Read [`AGENT.md`](./AGENT.md) and follow the instructions there.**
>
> `AGENT.md` contains the complete bootstrap sequence:
> - Check and install prerequisites (without overwriting working installs)
> - Configure MCP servers
> - Ask what the user wants to build
> - Plan and create data sources
> - Get design references
> - Build the app using Canvas Authoring MCP

## Quick start — what to say to your agent

Copy and paste this into your AI coding agent (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude, etc.):

```
Set up my Power Apps development environment.
Toolkit repo: https://github.com/KayodeAjayi200/powerplatform-ai-toolkit
Read AGENT.md from that repo and follow the setup instructions automatically.
```

If you have already cloned the repo locally:

```
Set up my Power Apps development environment.
Read AGENT.md from: C:\Repositories\powerplatform-ai-toolkit
Follow the setup instructions automatically.
```
