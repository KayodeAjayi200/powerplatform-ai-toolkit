# New App — End-to-End Workflow

This file gives the AI agent detailed guidance for building a new Power Apps canvas app from scratch.  
It expands on the high-level phases in `AGENT.md` with more detail on decision-making.

---

## Step 1 — Understand the app

Ask the user to describe:
- **What problem** the app solves
- **Who uses it** — roles, technical level, device (phone/tablet/desktop)
- **What actions** users perform (view data, submit records, approve requests, etc.)
- **Roughly how many records** the app will manage over time

Document the answers. You will use them to make datasource and design decisions.

---

## Step 2 — Identify data needs

From the description, identify every distinct **entity** the app needs to track.

For example, for a "Project Tracker" app:
- Projects (id, name, status, due date, owner)
- Tasks (id, project, description, assigned to, completed)
- Team members (id, name, email, role)

For each entity, list:
- Key columns and their types (Text, Number, Date, Choice, Lookup, etc.)
- Whether it relates to another entity (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Approximate volume (hundreds? thousands? millions?)

---

## Step 3 — Choose datasources

Read `setup/datasource-mcps.md` and apply the decision guide.

Present the plan:

```
Based on what you've described, here's what I plan to create:

  📊 Dataverse (recommended for this app):
     - Table: Project — stores project name, status, due date, owner
     - Table: Task — linked to Project; stores description, assignee, completion flag

  Everything will be in your [Environment Name] Power Platform environment.

Does this look right?
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 4 — Create data sources

Execute the creation commands from `setup/datasource-mcps.md` for the confirmed datasource type.

After creating each table or list:
- Confirm it exists by listing tables (`pac dataverse table list` for Dataverse)
- Note the exact table/list name — you'll need it when writing Power Fx formulas

---

## Step 5 — Plan screens

Design the screen architecture before opening Power Apps Studio.

**Common patterns:**

| App type | Typical screens |
|---|---|
| List + detail | Home/list, Detail view, Edit/create form |
| Approval workflow | My items, Pending approvals, Submit form, History |
| Dashboard | Summary dashboard, Drill-down list, Detail |
| Multi-step form | Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, Review + Submit, Confirmation |
| Field worker | My assignments, Job detail, Capture data/photo, Submit |

**Every screen must follow the container rules from `skills/canvas-design.md`:**
- Root: vertical container fills the screen
- Header: horizontal container with a deliberate fixed height only when it is app chrome
- Body: vertical container with `FlexibleHeight = true` and `FillPortions = 1`
- Navigation: left vertical panel (tablet) or bottom horizontal bar (phone)
- Main/side columns: use `FlexibleWidth = true`, `FillPortions`, and `AlignInContainer.Stretch` instead of `Width = Parent.Width * ...`
- Minimum sizes: add `MinimumWidth` or `MinimumHeight` only when real content clips below a known threshold, and use the smallest viable value
- Avoid fixed `Width`, `Height`, `X`, and `Y` for layout. Use them only for small fixed UI atoms such as icons, avatars, separators, and row heights.

## Step 6 — Get design references

Ask the user:

> "Do you have any of the following?
> - Brand colours (hex codes) or a brand guide
> - A company logo (PNG or SVG)
> - Screenshots of apps you'd like yours to look like
> - A style preference: clean/minimal, bold/dark, colourful, corporate
>
> Paste or describe anything you have. If nothing specific, I'll use Microsoft Fluent design."

Map their answer to a colour palette. For Fluent default:
- Primary action: `#0078D4` (Microsoft Blue)
- Background: `#F3F2F1`
- Surface/card: `#FFFFFF`
- Text: `#201F1E`
- Subtle text: `#605E5C`
- Destructive: `#D13438`

---

## Step 7 — Connect to Canvas Authoring MCP

Follow `skills/canvas-authoring-mcp.md` to:

1. Ask user to open/create the app in Power Apps Studio
2. Extract App ID and Environment ID from the Studio URL
3. Update the MCP config with those IDs
4. Sync the current state of the app

---

## Step 8 — Build each screen

Build one screen at a time:

1. **Write valid YAML first** using `skills/canvas-yaml.md` and a synced screen/control as the structural template
2. **Follow the app/design rules** in `skills/canvas-app.md` and `skills/canvas-design.md`
3. **Connect data** — reference the tables/lists created in Step 4
4. **Run YAML preflight** — check top-level keys, `Children` structure, required `Control`, formula `=` prefixes, data source names, and component references before compiling
5. **Compile** after each screen to catch errors early
6. **Move to the next screen** only when the current one compiles cleanly

### Accessibility (mandatory)

Before finishing each screen, apply the rules from `skills/canvas-accessibility.md`:
- Every interactive control has `AccessibleLabel` set
- Every image has a descriptive `AccessibleLabel`
- Tab order (`TabIndex`) follows a logical left-to-right, top-to-bottom sequence
- Form fields have a visible label associated with them
- Error messages are surfaced via accessible text, not just colour

### Delegation (check before writing filters)

Before writing any `Filter()` or `Search()` formula, check `skills/delegation.md`:
- Confirm the datasource and column type support delegation
- Never increase the app's data row limit as a workaround
- If the column doesn't support delegation, restructure the query

## Step 9 — Test and hand off

Before handing off:
1. Preview the app in Studio (F5) and verify each screen loads
2. Test submitting a record and verify it appears in the data source
3. Test navigation between all screens
4. Check the app on the target device form factor (phone vs tablet)

Hand off checklist to give the user:

- [ ] App is published (File → Save → Publish)
- [ ] Data sources connected and working
- [ ] App shared with intended users (Apps → `⋯` → Share)
- [ ] User knows how to access it (browser URL or Power Apps mobile app)
